# MyFitTrack

MyFitTrack is a full-stack nutrition and fitness tracking app built for personal use and to help friends and family achieve their health goals.

## 🚀 Why I Made It

I built MyFitTrack because i wanted an ai integrated tool to track my nutrition progress as most of the apps out there requires a subscription, so i challenged myself to build this full-stack app with the assist of ai.

## 🛠️ How I Made It

The app was built from the ground up with the help of Ai using:

- A **Django REST Framework** backend for the API
- A **Vue 3 (Vite)** frontend for the web version
- **Capacitor** to wrap the web app into an Android APK
- Deployed using **Render** for the backend, **Railway** for the database and **Vercel** for the frontend

Capacitor allowed me to bundle the same Vue frontend as a native Android app, so users can use it both on their phones and on the web.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Vue 3 + Vite
- Vue Router
- Axios
- Capacitor

### Backend
- Django
- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL (on Railway)

### Tools & Deployment
- Render (Backend)
- Netlify or Firebase Hosting (Frontend)
- Android Studio (for building the APK)
- Capacitor + Android SDK (for packaging mobile app)
